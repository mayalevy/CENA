Description: CENA is a method for a joint identification of pairwise association together with the particular subset of cells in
	which the association is detected. The algorithm relies on the input cell-state space to ensure a common cell state of all cells in the inferred cell 		subset. In this implementation, CENA tests association between multiple pairs of features: the expression of each gene against one additional meta-data.
